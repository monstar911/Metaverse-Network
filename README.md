# 1. Introduction
Bit.Country is a decentralized world. The concept is uniquely invented and inspired by the decentralization paradigm.
Its vision is to allow anyone (especially new users to the blockchain) to create their communities, economics as Bit Country on the blockchain network.

Users can create their own countries, blocks, sections, and items as digital assets with NFTs. The UI offers both a classical web view and a 3D in-browser view of the country. The decentralized marketplace allows users to trade their digital assets with each other.

Bit.Country provides a new way to socialize with a game feel, while also being driven by real economics.
